### Hello there!

This repo contains various exercises and tutorials I have done on my quest to learn about machine learning and ai.

Here you will find mostly scripts and snippets of different machine learning models I have played with, tutorials from books I have read and courses I have taken, as well as my own experiments with different libraries and data sets I have found interesting.

This should serve mostly as a reference for me rather than a show room for finished projects, so please excuse the code being a bit messy from time to time.

Every directory represents a different resource I have learned from. 
I have exported the conda environment I have used for a specific project to its directory.
